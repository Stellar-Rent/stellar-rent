## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

### Core Architecture
StellarRent connects property owners and tenants through a decentralized platform on Stellar. Owners list properties via Soroban smart contracts, tenants pay with USDC, and payments are secured in an escrow contract until rental conditions are met.
