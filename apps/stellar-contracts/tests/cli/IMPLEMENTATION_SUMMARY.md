# Smart Contract Testing Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Issue #137 - Test Smart Contracts

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

This implementation replaces the current broken test suite with a comprehensive CLI-based testing system using the official Stellar CLI tools.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### ✅ Core Requirements Met

1. **✅ Replace current test suite with official Stellar CLI**
   - All tests now use `stellar contract build`, `stellar contract deploy`, and `stellar contract invoke`
   - Removed dependency on broken test scripts

2. **✅ Compile contracts using stellar contract build**
   - `compile.sh` script compiles all contracts
   - Validates WASM file creation and integrity
   - Generates build information and reports

3. **✅ Deploy contracts to testnet using stellar contract deploy**
   - `deploy.sh` script deploys all contracts to Stellar testnet
   - Initializes contracts and stores contract addresses
   - Verifies deployment success

4. **✅ Use stellar contract invoke to test contract functions**
   - Individual test scripts for each contract
   - Comprehensive function testing with `stellar contract invoke`
   - Cross-contract integration testing

5. **✅ Replace broken test scripts with CLI-driven tests**
   - Complete replacement of existing test infrastructure
   - Robust error handling and reporting
   - Developer-friendly interfaces

6. **✅ Validate contract deployment and function execution in testnet**
   - Real testnet deployment and testing
   - Contract address management and verification
   - End-to-end validation workflows

7. **✅ CLI-based scripts available for developers to run tests locally**
   - Interactive menu system (`test.sh`)
   - Master test runner (`run-all-tests.sh`)
   - NPM scripts for easy access
   - Comprehensive documentation

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
cd apps/stellar-contracts
./tests/cli/test.sh
```

### Command Line
```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/cli/run-all-tests.sh

# Run specific tests
./tests/cli/test-booking.sh
./tests/cli/test-property-listing.sh
./tests/cli/test-review.sh
./tests/cli/integration-test.sh
```

### NPM Scripts
```bash
npm run test:all
npm run test:booking
npm run test:property
npm run test:review
npm run test:integration
```

## 📊 Test Results & Reporting

### JSON Test Reports
All tests generate comprehensive JSON reports:
```json
{
  "test_timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "contract_id": "CB3ILSDNHL6TWZYZJAS4L27GLHNAGW4ISW6YXIBHGHL4QYI4JPLP6W3E",
  "network": "testnet",
  "test_summary": {
    "total_tests": 25,
    "passed": 24,
    "failed": 1
  },
  "test_results": [...]
}
```

### Contract Address Management

```json
{
  "booking": "CB3ILSDNHL6TWZYZJAS4L27GLHNAGW4ISW6YXIBHGHL4QYI4JPLP6W3E",
  "property_listing": "PROPERTY_CONTRACT_ID",
  "review_contract": "REVIEW_CONTRACT_ID",
